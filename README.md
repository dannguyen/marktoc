# general-marktoc

A Python library for generating table of contents for a Markdown file


Similar to:

- [jonschlinkert/markdown-toc](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc), which is implemented in Node, and is the library I would recommend for most usecases.
- [ekalinin/github-markdown-toc](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc), which is implemented in Bash
