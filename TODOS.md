# TODOS

## Priority

- implement Parser.find_headers
- How should output be handled? With another class?


## Parser

- Do I have to handle the alternative headline syntax?
- better name than parser?
- inventory/map methods for dryruns

## Cli

- `go` should not be a subcommand
- option for inline replacement
- option to not include extra anchor markup
    - aka Github README style
- max-level=3 (only h1,h2,h3 are documented)
- back-to-top anchor after every other section
